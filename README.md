# `engrave` --- the adaptive/high definition screening (halftoning) program

The `engrave` program transforms continuous tone (CT) raster images
into EPS image files with embedded adaptive screening script. The
resulting EPS files are ready to be processed by any PostScript raster
image processor supporting PS Level 3 or later.
